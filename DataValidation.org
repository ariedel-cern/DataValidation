THESIS

* Data Validation
  Chapter 3 in the thesis. Data and all action performed on the data need to be validate before we can start with data analysis.
  ** Cuts
  Validate defautl cuts on run 137161 in centrality bin 0-80 and show difference between default cuts with/without centrality/multiplicity correlation cuts.
  ** High multiplicity outliers
  Basically the same as above, but in centrality bins 0-5 5-10 10-20 ... 70-80
  ** Trending
  Look at how observables behave run by run. Do this for 2-particle correlators. Also check the average values for azimuthal angel and centrality to validate that they are (mostly) flat.
  ** Kinematic Weights
  Compute kinematic weights run by run using Monte Carlo data set anchored in LCH10h.
