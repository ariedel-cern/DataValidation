# Data Validation

## DefaultCuts
Validation of default cuts and correlation cuts in centrality 0-80%.

## DefaultCuts_Binned
Validation that the default get rid of high multitiplicity outliers in the single centrality bins.

## Trending
Validation that observables are stable run by run and that azimuthal angle and centrality distributions are (mostly) flat.

## MultiplicityWeights
Show that the choosen multiplicity weights are valid by computing correlators with a fixed multiplicity event by event.

## KinematicWeights
Compute kinematic weights using Monte Carlo data and validate them.
